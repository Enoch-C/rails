      q1: What is a dietary supplement?
      a1_1: 'According to the FDA, a dietary supplement is “a product intended for ingestion that contains a "dietary ingredient" intended to add further nutritional value to, or to supplement, the diet. A "dietary ingredient" may be one, or any combination, of the following substances:'
      a1_2_1: a vitamin
      a1_2_2: a mineral
      a1_2_3: an herb or other botanical

      a1_2_6: a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, or extract
      a1_3: Dietary supplements may be found in many forms such as tablets, capsules, softgels, gelcaps, liquids, or powders. Some dietary supplements can help ensure that you get an adequate dietary intake of essential nutrients; others may help you reduce your risk of disease.”
      q2: What are the benefits of dietary supplements?
      a2: Dietary supplements are a great way to aid your body in getting the vital nutrients that it needs. These nutrients can be gained through a healthy diet, however studies show that we don’t always eat the way we need or should. Supplements should not be substituted for a healthy diet but are an easy and effective way to maintain a healthy lifestyle.
      q3: Are there any risks in taking supplements?
      a3: Yes. Many supplements have upper limits (UL) that should not be exceeded and could have potentially threatening side effects. However, Cool Choice has pre-tested and pre-measured each ingredient to prevent toxicity. Some combinations are not recommended to be combined, and an alternative selection will be requested. It is always wise to consult your doctor or health advisor before taking any dietary supplements.
      q4: Is Cool Choice Safe?
      a4: Yes. Cool Choice is safe and healthy to consume, as it is made with natural ingredients and contains no preservatives, questionable additives, artificial colors, artificial flavors, or artificial sweeteners.
      q5: Where can I find a list of what supplements Cool Choice uses?
      a5_1: Visit the Ingredients page on the Cool Choice website (

      q6: What is the recommended serving per day?
      a6: We recommend taking one Cool Choice 3-in-1 packet each day as part of a healthy lifestyle.
      q7: How do I take Cool Choice?
      a7: To take Cool Choice, simply pour your 3-in-1 packet into a 4 – 8 fl oz (120 – 240 ml) glass of water or other beverage. Mix and enjoy! Avoid mixing Cool Choice with hot liquids, as it may render some of the ingredients (such as the probiotic) less effective or inactive.
      q8: When should I take Cool Choice?
      a8_1: Most Cool Choice supplements can be taken with meals or at any time of the day. However, the Sleep Support Supplement should only be taken before sleep*, and the Energy supplement should not be taken before sleep.
      a8_2: '* Warning: Because the Sleep Support supplement contains melatonin, it may cause drowsiness. Use caution when operating a car or dangerous machinery.'
      q9: What are the supplement facts for Cool Choice?
      a9: Since Cool Choice supplements are personalized, each supplement label is different and therefore generated upon each purchase. Your personalized supplement label will come with each 7-day or 30-day purchase.
      q10: What flavors does Cool Choice come in?
      a10: 'Cool Choice comes in two flavors: lemon and strawberry. Each supplement is preassigned a flavor, so depending on which supplements you select, the flavor options are: lemon, strawberry, or strawberry lemonade. '
      q11: Do I get to choose my flavor?
      a11: Since Cool Choice supplement flavors are already preassigned, you will not get to choose your flavor. However, all supplements and their flavors are listed on our website and app and can be referred to before purchase.
      q12: Do Cool Choice supplements taste good?
      a12: Many supplements have an unpleasant taste due to the nature of the active compounds they contain. However, Cool Choice’s scientists have designed each supplement to be taken in an easy-to-take, pleasant-tasting powder form. Each Cool Choice supplement pack you design will be in a base of soluble vegetable fiber, naturally flavored with lemon and/or strawberry, and mildly sweetened with a natural sweetener. Taking supplements has never tasted better!
      q13: Does Cool Choice accept returns or refunds?
      a13_1: Cool Choice is the first-ever personalized supplement line. Due to the uniqueness and     personalization of each supplement order, returns and refunds are not accepted.
      a13_2: However, if you are unhappy with your purchase, we will gladly replace your order with another choice (one time only) or credit your account for the purchase fee to be used towards any future orders. Shipping and handling fees may apply to a replacement package.

      p23: Visiting Our Sites In general, you can visit our Sites without telling us who you are or providing us with any information. However, we collect the IP (Internet protocol) addresses of all visitors to our Sites and other related information such as page requests, browser type, operating system and average time spent on our Sites. We use this information to monitor and improve our Sites.
      p24: Cookies and Tracer Tags Our Sites use a technology called "cookies". A cookie is a tiny element of data that our Sites can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive so we can recognize you when you return. All pages on our Sites where you are prompted to log in or that are customizable require that you accept cookies. If you have registered with our Sites, these cookies (1) may let us know who you are, (2) are necessary to access your account information (stored on our computers) in order to deliver products and personalized services, and (3) will provide us and our Service Providers with information that we will use to personalize our Sites in accordance with your preferences. Cookies are also required to optimize your shopping experience in that they allow you to add multiple items to your shopping basket before checking out. You may set your Web browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. However, should you decide not to accept cookies from our Sites, you will limit the functionality we can provide when you visit our Sites.
      p25: We may use the services of third parties to collect and use anonymous information about your visits to and interactions with our website through the use of technologies such as cookies to personalize advertisements for goods and services.

      detail_Anti-Aging: '人體是由數以百萬計的細胞一起工作，以便我們能完成所有的日常職能。當我們年輕的時候，我們的身體細胞正處於生長發育期，處於最佳狀態。隨著我們年齡的增長，我們體內的細胞進入了一個衰老的過程，它表現在身體機能和機能的各個方面的下降。超氧化物歧化酶(SOD)，是一種強大的抗衰老補充成分，有助於保護和修復細胞的損傷和快速老化。'
      detail_Beauty: '皮膚是身體最大的器官，每天我們的皮膚會直接或間接接觸: 化學物質——乳液、化妝、古龍香水;汙染物，汽車尾氣，香煙的煙霧;有害的紫外線輻射。壓力和營養不良也會影響皮膚的健康。'
      detail_Brain_Care: '當我們年輕時，我們的大腦就像一塊海綿，能夠輕易吸收我們能找到的所有信息並儲存在我們的記憶中。我們一次性學習幾種語言，適合在很年輕的時候，這就是一個眾所周知的事實。當我們變老，我們開始越來越難記住一些名字或事情，我們記憶或回憶信息的能力下降是大腦老化的其中一種表現。我們記憶信息的能力隨著歲月的流逝而逐漸衰退。大腦細胞通信(大腦信號)通過一系列稱為神經元的網絡來傳遞信息。隨著年齡增長，大腦神經元傳遞信息的能力減弱。這時，大腦就需要一種能量，以幫助迅速啟動腦細胞並保持神經元的工作效率。'
      detail_Digestive_Care: '我們的腸道內有許多有益的微生物，它們被稱為益生菌。它們在腸道中能夠促進食物被良好地消化，也幫助我們的身體抵抗疾病的能力，提高我們的免疫力。不良的飲食習慣和疾病，尤其是我們有時不得不服用的抗生素，會大大減少我們腸道內益生菌的數量，導致一些胃腸不適，以及因免疫力下降而使我們更容易受到病菌侵襲。'
      detail_Energy: '現代社會的工作、學習、運動等等日常活動都會耗費我們的精力，常常會讓我們感到筋疲力盡，疲累不堪。在這時，我們就會去咖啡店買杯咖啡，或者花時間去泡一杯濃茶，以此來提神醒腦、補充精力。
南非醉茄提取物其實是更好的選擇。只要每日補充南非醉茄，就能時時充滿能量，省去花在咖啡店和泡茶上的時間，用更多的時間去完成自己的生活列表。'
      detail_Eye_Care: '我們日常常用的設備，如手機、ipad、電腦，遊戲設備如X-BOX、遊戲基地、任天堂遊戲機等已經成為我們最好的朋友。無論我們去哪裏，我們都會隨身攜帶它們，我們不斷的與它們保持在線互動，我們的生活中已經不能沒有它們。然而，這些設備發出藍色的光，會損害我們的眼睛，導致我們最終視力低下。'
      detail_Heart_Care: '心臟需要能量才能正常工作。隨著年齡的增長，精力的下降會引起各種心血管疾病。'
      detail_Immune_Support: '隨著我們的成長，我們的身體不斷暴露在微生物環境中，這會使我們生病。一個正常健康的身體免疫力的發展，幫助擊退這些疾病的致病微生物。不良的飲食、壓力和感染會使我們身體的免疫系統變得虛弱。為了消除這些免疫隱患，Cool Choice推出了β葡聚糖免疫保健產品。'
      detail_Joint_Care: '人體就像一個汽車引擎，我們需要定期更換機油，以保證汽車發動機的運轉，使其能夠有效地潤滑運動部件，使它們平穩地運動，並對零件沒有任何壓力。沒有潤滑，引擎將失去性能，並終將崩潰。人體有許多運動器官，其中，關節的摩擦和壓力是最大的。跑步、散步、和任何形式的活動，都容易損傷我們的關節。如果我們無法定期正確地潤滑關節，與關節相關的許多疾病，包括關節炎等，最終會找上我們。為了解決這個問題，Cool Choice推薦您選擇氨基葡萄糖進行關節護理。'
      detail_Liver_Care: '過度飲酒，某些類型的病毒，以及攝入過多的脂肪和不良的飲食習慣都會給肝臟造成很大壓力。這些因素最終傷害肝臟，導致肝臟停止正常運作。如果不糾正的話，肝臟可能最終停止運作、衰敗。假如沒有適當的飲食和運動來保持肝臟功能健康，某些補充劑也可以幫助消除這些毒素。'
      detail_Lung_Care: '我們的肺就好像身體的空氣凈化器，吸入氧氣，把空氣中的灰塵、汙垢等臟物過濾。
空氣凈化器需要定期更換濾網或者清洗，否則就容易積攢灰塵，影響機器的運行性能。
肺也是如此。Cool Choice專有的有機草本配方，能夠需對肺泡進行清潔和更新，保證肺部的健康，確保肺部良好的工作能力。'
      detail_Mens_Vitality: ' '
      detail_Sleep_Support: '我們不能認為，身體僅僅需要一個完整的6到8小時高質量的睡眠，這樣我們就可以在白天正常工作。這是不夠的，身體所需足夠的睡眠時間，但保證睡眠質量也是非常重要的。你有沒有經歷過有時醒來，仍然感覺疲倦不堪？這是因為你的身體沒有得到所需要的高質量的睡眠。這可能是因為你擔心第二天的考試，你與愛人在睡前的親密，或者你因為第二天一早有事，害怕睡過頭遲到。不管原因是什麽，它都會影響你一天的工作質量，影響你最佳水平的發揮。'
      detail_Stress_Management: '這個世界充滿了壓力。要努力完成學業，準備考試，要去面試工作，交通駕駛、限期完成工作，或者限期交繳賬單等等，都是現代生活帶來的許多壓力。恒定的壓力會影響我們的身體，在許多不同的方面使我們的免疫力低下，導致生病、體重增加、精神抑郁等。'
