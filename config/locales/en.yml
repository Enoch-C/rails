      detail_Anti-Aging: 'Thanks to trillions of cells that work together in harmony, our bodies are able to perform their daily functions. When we are young, our bodies’ cells are in a period of growth and development, and their   performance is optimal. As we age, however, our cells break down, inhibiting bodily functions. Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) is a potent anti-aging and anti-oxidant supplement that helps to protect and repair cells from age-related damage.'
      detail_Beauty: The skin is the largest organ of the body, and it performs a number of vital functions. Not only does our skin hold in fluids to prevent dehydration, but it also acts as a barrier from harmful microbes, allows us to feel (thanks to nerves found in the epidermis), and assists in regulating our body temperature. Unfortunately, every day our skin is victim to chemicals, pollutants, UV radiation, stress, and/or poor nutrition. These harmful factors cause our skin to become less healthy over time, thus losing its firmness, moisture, and elasticity, and resulting in wrinkles and fine lines. Bioactive collagen peptides help to improve overall skin health, increasing the effectiveness of the skin at performing its essential functions and reducing wrinkles and fine lines.
      detail_Brain_Care: When we are young, our brains are like sponges, processing information efficiently and storing it in the form of memories. Due to aging, our brains become less effective, and we experience a decline in our ability to store and recall information. This is caused by the degeneration of brain cells (called neurons), which communicate through a dense web of synaptic connections. As we age, the ability of synapses to transmit information diminishes. In order to function properly, the brain needs an energy source to keep the synapses working efficiently. Citicoline aids in this by supporting brain signaling and improving memory health.
      detail_Digestive_Care: Our stomachs are home to trillions of beneficial microorganisms called probiotics, which are essential for our bodies to function properly. Poor diet, illness, and antibiotic medications reduce the number of beneficial probiotics in our stomachs, inhibiting our ability to efficiently digest food and fight disease. The probiotic Bacillus Coagulans can be supplemented to replenish our stores of probiotics, thereby improving digestive health and immune functions.
      detail_Energy: "While our modern world boasts many incredible amenities and opportunities, it can at times be draining, both mentally and physically. In order to keep up with the hustle and bustle of our day-to-day lives, we could all benefit from having some extra energy. Ashwagandha has been used for thousands of years to boost energy and concentration. The positive benefits it provides makes it the perfect replacement for the daily cup of coffee, allowing us to skip the line at the local coffee shop and have more time and energy to spend on work or school—as well as with loved ones."
      detail_Eye_Care: It goes without saying that we are attached at the hip with our cell phones, tablets, and other devices. We take them everywhere we go and interact with them constantly. These devices, however, emit blue light, damaging our eyes and causing poor vision over time. Natural Lutein and Zeaxanthin help protect and repair our damaged eyes by acting as a filter to block the damaging light from these devices and providing nutritional support for visual health and acuity.
      detail_Heart_Care: Like all of our organs, the heart needs energy to function properly. As we age, the heart’s source of energy declines, causing various cardiovascular conditions. Co-Q10, derived from a natural fermentation process, helps support cardiovascular health by supplying the heart with a source of energy.
      detail_Immune_Support: As we age, our bodies are exposed to bacteria and viruses that cause illness. A healthy body develops immunity to help fight off these sickness-causing organisms, but poor diet, stress, and infection weaken our bodies’ immune systems. In order to combat this, beta-glucan (produced through natural fermentation) helps modulate the body’s immune defense system, increasing its ability to fight illness.
      detail_Joint_Care: The human body is a hyper-complex vehicle, and just like we regularly change the oil in our cars, we need to re-lubricate our joints in order to cause minimal stress. Friction and physical stress are the greatest in our joints, caused from running, walking, and any form of physical activity. To address joint issues (such as arthritis), glucosamine can be supplemented to help keep our joints in good shape by helping to build and repair cartilage—the tissue that cushions the joints.
      detail_Liver_Care: Alcohol consumption, exposure to pollutants, viruses, excessive fat, and poor diet put an extraordinary amount of strain on the liver. These factors can damage the liver to the point that it stops functioning properly, eventually causing it to fail altogether. While there is no substitute for proper diet, exercise, and a healthy lifestyle to maintain healthy liver function, certain supplements may help our livers to function optimally. Milk thistle and artichoke extracts help to improve liver function and repair liver damage.
      detail_Lung_Care: Our lungs serve as a filter in our bodies, allowing the essentials to enter (like oxygen), while keeping the unnecessary out (like dust and dirt). Our organic proprietary herbal blend aids our lungs by helping renew the cells that filter out the bad, keeping them working at optimum capacity, and promoting efficient oxygen intake and respiratory performance.
      detail_Mens_Vitality: A common side-effect of aging in men is decreased sexual performance. Malaysian ginseng extract, a rare herb from Southeast Asia, is a natural way to combat this issue. It has been shown to enhance energy, sexual performance, stamina, and libido, as well as naturally raise the body’s testosterone levels.
      detail_Sleep_Support: Have you ever woken up in the morning and already felt tired? This is because your body did not get the amount and quality sleep that it needs. While it is well known that the body requires a full 6 to 8 hours of sleep per night in order to function properly, it must not be overlooked that the quality of sleep is also very important. When taken before bedtime*, melatonin can be used to help support and improve the quality of sleep**.
      detail_Stress_Management: The world is filled with stress, especially in this day and age. Work deadlines, exams, job interviews, traffic, and financial struggles are just some of the many stressors that the modern world has to offer. Constant stress affects our body in a variety of negative ways, causing us to get sick, gain weight, struggle with depression, and even become victim of heart disease. L-theanine helps improve learning performance, focus, and mental clarity, promoting concentration and helping to reduce stress, restlessness, nervousness, and irritability.

The average American is exposed to about 10-12 hours of blue light per day. Lutein and zeaxanthin act as primary filter against high-energy blue light and help protect against oxidative stress and inflammation.
      more1_Heart_Care: Cool Choice Heart Care contains soluble Co-Enzyme Q10 (Co-Q10) to help support heart health. As we age, the amount of Co-Q10 in the body declines. Supplementation can increase the levels of Co-Q10 in the body.

      more1_Sleep_Support: Melatonin normalizes sleep patterns, day/night rhythms, and protects the immune system from stress. As we age, natural levels of melatonin decline, affecting normal sleep patterns.
      more1_Stress_Management: Research suggests that L-theanine helps improve learning performance, focus, and mental clarity, promote concentration, improve sleep quality, reduce normal PMS symptoms, reduce the side effects of caffeine, and support the immune system.

      more2_Beauty: Collagen peptides also help retain and increase skin moisture and slow the formation of wrinkles.
      more2_Brain_Care: Cognizin citicoline supports focus and attention. It helps promote healthy brain function by supplying the brain with the energy it needs to stay sharp and active.

      more2_Joint_Care: Studies have shown that glucosamine helps in reducing osteoarthritis symptoms.
      more2_Liver_Care: Milk thistle stabilizes the cell membrane and stimulates protein synthesis, while accelerating regeneration of damaged liver cells and reducing inflammation.
      more2_Lung_Care: Cool Choice Lung Care helps support healthy respiration by promoting secretion of fluids, moistening the lungs to control cough due to dry lungs.
      more2_Mens_Vitality: Eurycoma longifolia extract contains eurypeptides, which are known to enhance energy, sexual performance, stamina, and libido. Users have reported an increase in energy and endurance.
      more2_Sleep_Support: Melatonin is a natural anti-oxidant, which helps the body fight against free-radicals that cause damage.
      more2_Stress_Management: L-theanine promotes a sense of relaxation, reduces stress and restlessness, helps ease nervousness and irritability, and gently soothes tension away.  It works to suppress glucocorticoids, which give the body and mind a feeling of “stress”.

      q2: What are the benefits of dietary supplements?
      a2: Dietary supplements are a great way to aid your body in getting the vital nutrients that it needs. These nutrients can be gained through a healthy diet, however studies show that we don’t always eat the way we need or should. Supplements should not be substituted for a healthy diet but are an easy and effective way to maintain a healthy lifestyle.
      q3: Are there any risks in taking supplements?
      a3: Yes. Many supplements have upper limits (UL) that should not be exceeded and could have potentially threatening side effects. However, Cool Choice has pre-tested and pre-measured each ingredient to prevent toxicity. Some combinations are not recommended to be combined, and an alternative selection will be requested. It is always wise to consult your doctor or health advisor before taking any dietary supplements.
      q4: Is Cool Choice Safe?

      a6: We recommend taking one Cool Choice 3-in-1 packet each day as part of a healthy lifestyle.
      q7: How do I take Cool Choice?
      a7: To take Cool Choice, simply pour your 3-in-1 packet into a 4 – 8 fl oz (120 – 240 ml) glass of water or other beverage. Mix and enjoy! Avoid mixing Cool Choice with hot liquids, as it may render some of the ingredients (such as the probiotic) less effective or inactive.
      q8: When should I take Cool Choice?
      a8_1: Most Cool Choice supplements can be taken with meals or at any time of the day. However, the Sleep Support Supplement should only be taken before sleep*, and the Energy supplement should not be taken before sleep.
      a8_2: '* Warning: Because the Sleep Support supplement contains melatonin, it may cause drowsiness. Use caution when operating a car or dangerous machinery.'
      q9: What are the supplement facts for Cool Choice?
      a9: Since Cool Choice supplements are personalized, each supplement label is different and therefore generated upon each purchase. Your personalized supplement label will come with each 7-day or 30-day purchase.
      q10: What flavors does Cool Choice come in?
      a10: 'Cool Choice comes in two flavors: lemon and strawberry. Each supplement is preassigned a flavor, so depending on which supplements you select, the flavor options are: lemon, strawberry, or strawberry lemonade. '
      q11: Do I get to choose my flavor?
      a11: Since Cool Choice supplement flavors are already preassigned, you will not get to choose your flavor. However, all supplements and their flavors are listed on our website and app and can be referred to before purchase.
      q12: Do Cool Choice supplements taste good?
      a12: Many supplements have an unpleasant taste due to the nature of the active compounds they contain. However, Cool Choice’s scientists have designed each supplement to be taken in an easy-to-take, pleasant-tasting powder form. Each Cool Choice supplement pack you design will be in a base of soluble vegetable fiber, naturally flavored with lemon and/or strawberry, and mildly sweetened with a natural sweetener. Taking supplements has never tasted better!
      q13: Does Cool Choice accept returns or refunds?
      a13_1: Cool Choice is the first-ever personalized supplement line. Due to the uniqueness and     personalization of each supplement order, returns and refunds are not accepted.
      a13_2: However, if you are unhappy with your purchase, we will gladly replace your order with another choice (one time only) or credit your account for the purchase fee to be used towards any future orders. Shipping and handling fees may apply to a replacement package.

However, we collect the IP (Internet protocol) addresses of all visitors to our Sites and other related information such as page requests, browser type, operating system and average time spent on our Sites. We use this information to monitor and improve our Sites.
      p24: Cookies and Tracer Tags Our Sites use a technology called "cookies". A cookie is a tiny element of data that our Sites can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive so we can recognize you when you return. All pages on our Sites where you are prompted to log in or that are customizable require that you accept cookies. If you have registered with our Sites, these cookies (1) may let us know who you are, (2) are necessary to access your account information (stored on our computers) in order to deliver products and personalized services, and (3) will provide us and our Service Providers with information that we will use to personalize our Sites in accordance with your preferences. Cookies are also required to optimize your shopping experience in that they allow you to add multiple items to your shopping basket before checking out. You may set your Web browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. However, should you decide not to accept cookies from our Sites, you will limit the functionality we can provide when you visit our Sites.
      p25: We may use the services of third parties to collect and use anonymous information about your visits to and interactions with our website through the use of technologies such as cookies to personalize advertisements for goods and services.
