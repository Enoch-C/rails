# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.

      detail_Anti-Aging: 'Thanks to trillions of cells that work together in harmony, our bodies are able to perform their daily functions. When we are young, our bodies’ cells are in a period of growth and development, and their   performance is optimal. As we age, however, our cells break down, inhibiting bodily functions. Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) is a potent anti-aging and anti-oxidant supplement that helps to protect and repair cells from age-related damage.'
      detail_Beauty: The skin is the largest organ of the body, and it performs a number of vital functions. Not only does our skin hold in fluids to prevent dehydration, but it also acts as a barrier from harmful microbes, allows us to feel (thanks to nerves found in the epidermis), and assists in regulating our body temperature. Unfortunately, every day our skin is victim to chemicals, pollutants, UV radiation, stress, and/or poor nutrition. These harmful factors cause our skin to become less healthy over time, thus losing its firmness, moisture, and elasticity, and resulting in wrinkles and fine lines. Bioactive collagen peptides help to improve overall skin health, increasing the effectiveness of the skin at performing its essential functions and reducing wrinkles and fine lines.
      detail_Brain_Care: When we are young, our brains are like sponges, processing information efficiently and storing it in the form of memories. Due to aging, our brains become less effective, and we experience a decline in our ability to store and recall information. This is caused by the degeneration of brain cells (called neurons), which communicate through a dense web of synaptic connections. As we age, the ability of synapses to transmit information diminishes. In order to function properly, the brain needs an energy source to keep the synapses working efficiently. Citicoline aids in this by supporting brain signaling and improving memory health.
      detail_Digestive_Care: Our stomachs are home to trillions of beneficial microorganisms called probiotics, which are essential for our bodies to function properly. Poor diet, illness, and antibiotic medications reduce the number of beneficial probiotics in our stomachs, inhibiting our ability to efficiently digest food and fight disease. The probiotic Bacillus Coagulans can be supplemented to replenish our stores of probiotics, thereby improving digestive health and immune functions.
      detail_Energy: ' '
      detail_Eye_Care: It goes without saying that we are attached at the hip with our cell phones, tablets, and other devices. We take them everywhere we go and interact with them constantly. These devices, however, emit blue light, damaging our eyes and causing poor vision over time. Natural Lutein and Zeaxanthin help protect and repair our damaged eyes by acting as a filter to block the damaging light from these devices and providing nutritional support for visual health and acuity.
      detail_Heart_Care: Like all of our organs, the heart needs energy to function properly. As we age, the heart’s source of energy declines, causing various cardiovascular conditions. Co-Q10, derived from a natural fermentation process, helps support cardiovascular health by supplying the heart with a source of energy.
      detail_Immune_Support: As we age, our bodies are exposed to bacteria and viruses that cause illness. A healthy body develops immunity to help fight off these sickness-causing organisms, but poor diet, stress, and infection weaken our bodies’ immune systems. In order to combat this, beta-glucan (produced through natural fermentation) helps modulate the body’s immune defense system, increasing its ability to fight illness.
      detail_Joint_Care: The human body is a hyper-complex vehicle, and just like we regularly change the oil in our cars, we need to re-lubricate our joints in order to cause minimal stress. Friction and physical stress are the greatest in our joints, caused from running, walking, and any form of physical activity. To address joint issues (such as arthritis), glucosamine can be supplemented to help keep our joints in good shape by helping to build and repair cartilage—the tissue that cushions the joints.
      detail_Liver_Care: Alcohol consumption, exposure to pollutants, viruses, excessive fat, and poor diet put an extraordinary amount of strain on the liver. These factors can damage the liver to the point that it stops functioning properly, eventually causing it to fail altogether. While there is no substitute for proper diet, exercise, and a healthy lifestyle to maintain healthy liver function, certain supplements may help our livers to function optimally. Milk thistle and artichoke extracts help to improve liver function and repair liver damage.
      detail_Lung_Care: Our lungs serve as a filter in our bodies, allowing the essentials to enter (like oxygen, for example), while keeping the unnecessary out (like dust and dirt). Our organic proprietary herbal blend aids our lungs by helping renew the cells that filter out the bad, keeping them working at optimum capacity, and promoting efficient oxygen intake and respiratory performance.
      detail_Mens_Vitality: A common side-effect of aging in men is decreased sexual performance. Malaysian ginseng extract, a rare herb from Southeast Asia, is a natural way to combat this issue. It has been shown to enhance energy, sexual performance, stamina, and libido, as well as naturally raise the body’s testosterone levels.
      detail_Sleep_Support: Have you ever woken up in the morning and already felt tired? This is because your body did not get the amount and quality sleep that it needs. While it is well known that the body requires a full 6 to 8 hours of sleep per night in order to function properly, it must not be overlooked that the quality of sleep is also very important. When taken before bedtime*, melatonin can be used to help support and improve the quality of sleep**.
      detail_Stress_Management: The world is filled with stress, especially in this day and age. Work deadlines, exams, job interviews, traffic, and financial struggles are just some of the many stressors that the modern world has to offer. Constant stress affects our body in a variety of negative ways, causing us to get sick, gain weight, struggle with depression, and even become victim of heart disease. L-theanine helps improve learning performance, focus, and mental clarity, promoting concentration and helping to reduce stress, restlessness, nervousness, and irritability.

Lutein and zeaxanthin act as primary filter against high-energy blue light and help protect against oxidative stress and inflammation.
      more1_Heart_Care: Cool Choice Heart Care contains soluble Co-Enzyme Q10 (Co-Q10) to help support heart health. As we age, the amount of Co-Q10 in the body declines. Supplementation can increase the levels of Co-Q10 in the body.

      more2_Sleep_Support: Melatonin is a natural anti-oxidant, which helps the body fight against free-radicals that cause damage.
      more2_Stress_Management: L-theanine promotes a sense of relaxation, reduces stress and restlessness, helps ease nervousness and irritability, and gently soothes tension away.  It works to suppress glucocorticoids, which give the body and mind a feeling of “stress”.
