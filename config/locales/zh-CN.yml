      q1: What is a dietary supplement?
      a1_1: 'According to the FDA, a dietary supplement is “a product intended for ingestion that contains a "dietary ingredient" intended to add further nutritional value to, or to supplement, the diet. A "dietary ingredient" may be one, or any combination, of the following substances:'
      a1_2_1: a vitamin

      a1_2_3: an herb or other botanical

      a1_3: Dietary supplements may be found in many forms such as tablets, capsules, softgels, gelcaps, liquids, or powders. Some dietary supplements can help ensure that you get an adequate dietary intake of essential nutrients; others may help you reduce your risk of disease.”
      q2: What are the benefits of dietary supplements?
      a2: Dietary supplements are a great way to aid your body in getting the vital nutrients that it needs. These nutrients can be gained through a healthy diet, however studies show that we don’t always eat the way we need or should. Supplements should not be substituted for a healthy diet but are an easy and effective way to maintain a healthy lifestyle.
      q3: Are there any risks in taking supplements?
      a3: Yes. Many supplements have upper limits (UL) that should not be exceeded and could have potentially threatening side effects. However, Cool Choice has pre-tested and pre-measured each ingredient to prevent toxicity. Some combinations are not recommended to be combined, and an alternative selection will be requested. It is always wise to consult your doctor or health advisor before taking any dietary supplements.
      q4: Is Cool Choice Safe?
      a4: Yes. Cool Choice is safe and healthy to consume, as it is made with natural ingredients and contains no preservatives, questionable additives, artificial colors, artificial flavors, or artificial sweeteners.
      q5: Where can I find a list of what supplements Cool Choice uses?
      a5_1: Visit the Ingredients page on the Cool Choice website (

      q6: What is the recommended serving per day?
      a6: We recommend taking one Cool Choice 3-in-1 packet each day as part of a healthy lifestyle.
      q7: How do I take Cool Choice?
      a7: To take Cool Choice, simply pour your 3-in-1 packet into a 4 – 8 fl oz (120 – 240 ml) glass of water or other beverage. Mix and enjoy! Avoid mixing Cool Choice with hot liquids, as it may render some of the ingredients (such as the probiotic) less effective or inactive.
      q8: When should I take Cool Choice?
      a8_1: Most Cool Choice supplements can be taken with meals or at any time of the day. However, the Sleep Support Supplement should only be taken before sleep*, and the Energy supplement should not be taken before sleep.
      a8_2: '* Warning: Because the Sleep Support supplement contains melatonin, it may cause drowsiness. Use caution when operating a car or dangerous machinery.'
      q9: What are the supplement facts for Cool Choice?
      a9: Since Cool Choice supplements are personalized, each supplement label is different and therefore generated upon each purchase. Your personalized supplement label will come with each 7-day or 30-day purchase.
      q10: What flavors does Cool Choice come in?
      a10: 'Cool Choice comes in two flavors: lemon and strawberry. Each supplement is preassigned a flavor, so depending on which supplements you select, the flavor options are: lemon, strawberry, or strawberry lemonade. '
      q11: Do I get to choose my flavor?
      a11: Since Cool Choice supplement flavors are already preassigned, you will not get to choose your flavor. However, all supplements and their flavors are listed on our website and app and can be referred to before purchase.
      q12: Do Cool Choice supplements taste good?
      a12: Many supplements have an unpleasant taste due to the nature of the active compounds they contain. However, Cool Choice’s scientists have designed each supplement to be taken in an easy-to-take, pleasant-tasting powder form. Each Cool Choice supplement pack you design will be in a base of soluble vegetable fiber, naturally flavored with lemon and/or strawberry, and mildly sweetened with a natural sweetener. Taking supplements has never tasted better!
      q13: Does Cool Choice accept returns or refunds?
      a13_1: Cool Choice is the first-ever personalized supplement line. Due to the uniqueness and     personalization of each supplement order, returns and refunds are not accepted.
      a13_2: However, if you are unhappy with your purchase, we will gladly replace your order with another choice (one time only) or credit your account for the purchase fee to be used towards any future orders. Shipping and handling fees may apply to a replacement package.

      p23: Visiting Our Sites In general, you can visit our Sites without telling us who you are or providing us with any information. However, we collect the IP (Internet protocol) addresses of all visitors to our Sites and other related information such as page requests, browser type, operating system and average time spent on our Sites. We use this information to monitor and improve our Sites.
      p24: Cookies and Tracer Tags Our Sites use a technology called "cookies". A cookie is a tiny element of data that our Sites can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive so we can recognize you when you return. All pages on our Sites where you are prompted to log in or that are customizable require that you accept cookies. If you have registered with our Sites, these cookies (1) may let us know who you are, (2) are necessary to access your account information (stored on our computers) in order to deliver products and personalized services, and (3) will provide us and our Service Providers with information that we will use to personalize our Sites in accordance with your preferences. Cookies are also required to optimize your shopping experience in that they allow you to add multiple items to your shopping basket before checking out. You may set your Web browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. However, should you decide not to accept cookies from our Sites, you will limit the functionality we can provide when you visit our Sites.
      p25: We may use the services of third parties to collect and use anonymous information about your visits to and interactions with our website through the use of technologies such as cookies to personalize advertisements for goods and services.

      detail_Anti-Aging: '人体是由数以百万计的细胞一起工作，以便我们能完成所有的日常职能。当我们年轻的时候，我们的身体细胞正处于生长发育期，处于最佳状态。随着我们年龄的增长，我们体内的细胞进入了一个衰老的过程，它表现在身体机能和机能的各个方面的下降。超氧化物歧化酶(SOD)，是一种强大的抗衰老补充成分，有助于保护和修复细胞的损伤和快速老化。'
      detail_Beauty: '皮肤是身体最大的器官，每天我们的皮肤会直接或间接接触: 化学物质——乳液、化妆、古龙香水;污染物，汽车尾气，香烟的烟雾;有害的紫外线辐射。压力和营养不良也会影响皮肤的健康。'
      detail_Brain_Care: '当我们年轻时，我们的大脑就像一块海绵，能够轻易吸收我们能找到的所有信息并储存在我们的记忆中。我们一次性学习几种语言，适合在很年轻的时候，这就是一个众所周知的事实。当我们变老，我们开始越来越难记住一些名字或事情，我们记忆或回忆信息的能力下降是大脑老化的其中一种表现。我们记忆信息的能力随着岁月的流逝而逐渐衰退。大脑细胞通信(大脑信号)通过一系列称为神经元的网络来传递信息。随着年龄增长，大脑神经元传递信息的能力减弱。这时，大脑就需要一种能量，以帮助迅速启动脑细胞并保持神经元的工作效率。'
      detail_Digestive_Care: '我们的肠道内有许多有益的微生物，它们被称为益生菌。它们在肠道中能够促进食物被良好地消化，也帮助我们的身体抵抗疾病的能力，提高我们的免疫力。不良的饮食习惯和疾病，尤其是我们有时不得不服用的抗生素，会大大减少我们肠道内益生菌的数量，导致一些胃肠不适，以及因免疫力下降而使我们更容易受到病菌侵袭。'
      detail_Energy: '现代社会的工作、学习、运动等等日常活动都会耗费我们的精力，常常会让我们感到筋疲力尽，疲累不堪。在这时，我们就会去咖啡店买杯咖啡，或者花时间去泡一杯浓茶，以此来提神醒脑、补充精力。
南非醉茄提取物其实是更好的选择。只要每日补充南非醉茄，就能时时充满能量，省去花在咖啡店和泡茶上的时间，用更多的时间去完成自己的生活列表。'
      detail_Eye_Care: '我们日常常用的设备，如手机、ipad、电脑，游戏设备如X-BOX、游戏基地、任天堂游戏机等已经成为我们最好的朋友。无论我们去哪里，我们都会随身携带它们，我们不断的与它们保持在线互动，我们的生活中已经不能没有它们。然而，这些设备发出蓝色的光，会损害我们的眼睛，导致我们最终视力低下。'
      detail_Heart_Care: '心脏需要能量才能正常工作。随着年龄的增长，精力的下降会引起各种心血管疾病。'
      detail_Immune_Support: '随着我们的成长，我们的身体不断暴露在微生物环境中，这会使我们生病。一个正常健康的身体免疫力的发展，帮助击退这些疾病的致病微生物。不良的饮食、压力和感染会使我们身体的免疫系统变得虚弱。为了消除这些免疫隐患，Cool Choice推出了β葡聚糖免疫保健产品。'
      detail_Joint_Care: '人体就像一个汽车引擎，我们需要定期更换机油，以保证汽车发动机的运转，使其能够有效地润滑运动部件，使它们平稳地运动，并对零件没有任何压力。没有润滑，引擎将失去性能，并终将崩溃。人体有许多运动器官，其中，关节的摩擦和压力是最大的。跑步、散步、和任何形式的活动，都容易损伤我们的关节。如果我们无法定期正确地润滑关节，与关节相关的许多疾病，包括关节炎等，最终会找上我们。为了解决这个问题，Cool Choice推荐您选择氨基葡萄糖进行关节护理。'
      detail_Liver_Care: '过度饮酒，某些类型的病毒，以及摄入过多的脂肪和不良的饮食习惯都会给肝脏造成很大压力。这些因素最终伤害肝脏，导致肝脏停止正常运作。如果不纠正的话，肝脏可能最终停止运作、衰败。假如没有适当的饮食和运动来保持肝脏功能健康，某些补充剂也可以帮助消除这些毒素。'
      detail_Lung_Care: '我们的肺就好像身体的空气净化器，吸入氧气，把空气中的灰尘、污垢等脏物过滤。
空气净化器需要定期更换滤网或者清洗，否则就容易积攒灰尘，影响机器的运行性能。
肺也是如此。Cool Choice专有的有机草本配方，能够需对肺泡进行清洁和更新，保证肺部的健康，确保肺部良好的工作能力。'
      detail_Mens_Vitality: ' '
      detail_Sleep_Support: '我们不能认为，身体仅仅需要一个完整的6到8小时高质量的睡眠，这样我们就可以在白天正常工作。这是不够的，身体所需足够的睡眠时间，但保证睡眠质量也是非常重要的。你有没有经历过有时醒来，仍然感觉疲倦不堪？这是因为你的身体没有得到所需要的高质量的睡眠。这可能是因为你担心第二天的考试，你与爱人在睡前的亲密，或者你因为第二天一早有事，害怕睡过头迟到。不管原因是什么，它都会影响你一天的工作质量，影响你最佳水平的发挥。'
      detail_Stress_Management: '这个世界充满了压力。要努力完成学业，准备考试，要去面试工作，交通驾驶、限期完成工作，或者限期交缴账单等等，都是现代生活带来的许多压力。恒定的压力会影响我们的身体，在许多不同的方面使我们的免疫力低下，导致生病、体重增加、精神抑郁等。'
